# Engineering Project
## San Diego Real Estate Market Summary based on Zip code


The Project will build a end-to-end data Engineering pipeline to provide statistical nearby airbnb property information for an interested property given zip, bedroom information.

So far I fetch data from zillow, insideairbnb and save data into DBMS MySQL. Then inquiry data from database, perform data wrangling according to input inquiry info, like Zip code, then use streamlit for app deployment and visualisation.

The attached plot is a basic app deployment. The page will show expected housing price increase by Zillow in the coming next year of the inquired Zip code area, it also shows map that list all airbnb properties in the inquired Zip Code.
